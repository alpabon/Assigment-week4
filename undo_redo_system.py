    #Why is a stack the right choice for undo/redo?
    #A stack is the right choice for undo/redo because it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recent action performed is the first one to be undone, which is perfect for how the users expect to undo functionality to work. When an action is undone, it can be pushed onto a redo stack, allowing users to redo actions in the reverse order they were undone.
#Why is a queue better suited for the help desk?
    #A queue is better suited for the help desk because it follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that customers are helped in the order they arrive. The first customer to enter the queue is the first one to be served, which is the normal situations when customer services are helping clients.
#How do your implementations differ from Pythonâ€™s built-in lists?
    #My implementations differ from pythons built-in lists because they are specifically designed to funcion as stacks and queues, also they have methods of data structures ( like push, pop for stacs and enqueue,dequeue for queues). built-in lists in pyhton are more general and not such an especific purpose and our data structures are fare mor efficient. also with the implementation of th eLIFO AND FIFO principles and linked nodes, the system is more memory efficient and time efficient
